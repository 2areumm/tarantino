<p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Proof" target="_blank" title="death proof information for wikipedia">Death proof</strong></a> is a 2007 American exploitation film written and directed by Quentin Tarantino.<br> It stars Kurt Russell as a stuntman who murders young women in staged car accidents using his "death-proof" stunt car. <br>It co-stars Rosario Dawson, Vanessa Ferlito, Jordan Ladd, Rose McGowan, Sydney Tamiia Poitier, Tracie Thoms and Mary Elizabeth Winstead, with stuntwoman Zoë Bell as herself. The film pays homage to the slasher, exploitation and muscle car films of the 1970s.

Death Proof was released theatrically in the United States as part of a double feature with Robert Rodriguez’s Planet Terror under the collective title Grindhouse, to recreate the experience of viewing exploitation film double features in a "grindhouse" theater. The films were released separately outside the United States and on DVD, with Death Proof going on sale in the U.S. on September 18, 2007.
